Welcome

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,948
For this coding challenge, we are given two strings.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,292
-a main string-

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,556
-and a target string.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,826
Our goal is to find the smallest section of the main

6
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:21,260
string that contains all the characters in the target string.
