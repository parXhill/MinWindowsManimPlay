1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Our goal is to find the minimum window within

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,540
which our string contains all the target letters.

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,232
We start by setting a left pointer that tracks

4
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:11,318
the index of the start of the window

5
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:15,254
And a right pointer that tracks the index of the end of the window

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,830
Now, we create a hashmap of the letters and

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,772
value counts that are present in our target string

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,756
And a hashmap that will track the

9
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:26,321
characters that appear in our current window

10
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,713
For our window to be complete, it must

11
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,430
contain all the values of the target string.

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,690
We start by expanding our window to the

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,670
right until it contains all the target characters.

14
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:04,803
When our window contains all the target characters, we

15
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:08,494
have met the requirements for our first minimum substring.

16
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:11,230
We stop expanding, and record the sequence.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,484
Then, to see whether we can make it any smaller,

18
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:19,675
we begin to contract our window from the left, removing

19
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:23,156
characters one by one to find the smallest viable substring.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,167
Once our window no longer contains all the target letters, we have

21
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,111
found the smallest viable sub-string so far. And so, we begin to

22
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:48,932
expand again towards the right to find the next viable window.

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,752
Once we have found another viable window, we stop expanding. If the

24
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:05,925
string is smaller than the minimum, we record it. Otherwise, we begin

25
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,312
to contract the window from the left again, to see if we

26
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,820
can find a viable string that is smaller than the minimum.
