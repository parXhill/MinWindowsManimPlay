00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Our goal is to find the minimum window within

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,540
which our string contains all the target letters.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,215
We start by setting a left pointer that tracks

4
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:11,302
the index of the start of the window

5
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:15,204
And a right pointer that tracks the index of the end of the window

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,746
Now, we create a hashmap of the letters and

7
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,688
value counts that are present in our target string

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,081
And a hashmap that will track the characters that appear

9
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:28,160
in our current window. For a window to be complete,

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,300
it must contain all the values of the target hashmap

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,356
We start by opening the current window and expanding it to the right
